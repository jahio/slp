At REDACTED, our speech language pathologists (SLPs) deal mostly with young
children. As such, they will often make use of materials during their therapy
sessions - handouts, worksheets, picture cards, etc. (this blog has some
examples of the type of materials a SLP might use:
http://slpmaterials.blogspot.com/)

The goal of this project is to create a (very) small Ruby on Rails application
that encapsulates the following functionality:

+ a user can upload a material resource they have created to share with others
+ a user can search / download from the library of resources that users have
  uploaded

Try to limit yourself to 10 hours or less for this project.

DO

+ Focus on the user experience. It should be first and foremost easy-to-use and
  functional. Bonus points for an aesthetically pleasing design (if it doesn't
  take away from the functionality).

DON'T

+ Spend time playing code golf. The code for this project should be relatively
  vanilla and straightforward. Your time will be best spent thinking about and
  working on the user experience.
